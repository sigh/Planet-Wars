Investigate invalid moves

Implement special neutral planet handling.
    - always invade planets where we can break even before opponent arrives

Restict units used in redistribution based on how quickly we can reach the enemy:
Eg: redistributing to units on the other side of the enemy should be done with caution

If we are completely protected by own planets then we can send out full growth rate

For attaking enemies, value close distance much more highly

Rage protection

Value neutrals in central position more highly
    (value any planets in central position more highly)

Value of planets MUST depend on surrounding situation (try eigenvalue closeness)

We are attacking enemies too far away because we think they are weak.
    In reality they only have a low ship count because they are sending all units to 
    other planets, and they can get reinforcements quicker than we can reach them.

Anticipate opponent: 
    effective growth rate - takes into account redistribution
    closeness measures - planets are strong if they can get reinforcements before we reach them

Handle defence as part of attack! To do this we have to allow src => dest fleets in attack mode. This 
will also allow us to abandon planets.

    - Idea: more conservative defence, don't just look at closest planet
