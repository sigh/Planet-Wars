Investigate invalid moves

Implement special neutral planet handling.
    - always invade planets where we can break even before opponent arrives

Restict units used in redistribution based on how quickly we can reach the enemy:
Eg: redistributing to units on the other side of the enemy should be done with caution

If we are completely protected by own planets then we can send out full growth rate

For attaking enemies, value close distance much more highly

Weakness/desirablity of planets MUST depend on surrounding location!
